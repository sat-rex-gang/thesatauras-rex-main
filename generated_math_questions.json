      "A: Nothing definite about the claim because without variability you cannot construct a confidence interval or test significance.",
      "B: The company is lying because your sample mean differs from $120.",
      "C: The true mean must be $120 because advertised averages are always accurate.",

      "C: r=0.6 implies 60% of variation in muscle mass is explained by protein intake.",
